* [README](../#readme): Get up-and-running with stack quickly. Requires no prior Haskell tooling experience
* [In-depth stack guide](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/blob/master/doc/GUIDE.md): Full tutorial covering all major stack features
* [Getting started with stack tutorial](http://seanhess.github.io/2015/08/04/practical-haskell-getting-started.html)

More detailed documents:

* [[Architecture]]: for people curious about the internals, wanting to use stack in unusual ways, or wanting to get involved deeply in the codebase
* [[stack.yaml]]: Reference documentation for writing `stack.yaml` files.
* [[Build command]]: covers the syntax of the build command and the command line targets

There's also the [[FAQ]] which will likely have something for everyone, and the [[Downloads]] page (which is linked from the README).
