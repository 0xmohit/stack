Primary documents:

1. [README](../#readme): Get up-and-running with stack quickly. Requires no prior Haskell tooling experience
2. [[New to Haskell]]: people new to Haskell trying to understand how the various pieces fit together should read this after following the README
3. [[Transition guide]]: existing Haskellers looking to start with stack and will be confused by things being missing, e.g. "How do I do sandboxing?"
4. [[Architecture]]: for people curious about the internals, wanting to use stack in unusual ways, or wanting to get involved deeply in the codebase

There's also the [[FAQ]] which will likely have something for everyone, and the [[Downloads]] page (which is linked from the README).
